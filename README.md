# RabelaisMarkov
A gargantuan experiment.

Inspired by all e_books twitter bots, the [Markov_Noodles Ruby gem](https://github.com/dabrorius/markov-noodles), [this Medium article](https://medium.com/@DebashisBarman/creating-a-twitter-bot-with-node-js-bea760b80bd5#.gbtf5vc6t) and [Gargantua and Pantagruel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel).

* Easily the funniest and filthiest book (in the public domain) I have ever read.

This is very much a work in progress. Check back for further updates.
